        The problems of the world are not going to solve itself and we need BOLD individuals who are very OPTIMISTIC about the future with a COMMON VISION to take up this initiative and that’s exactly why we believe in building products that transform your life for the better. 
        No matter how difficult the path in front looks like, there will be sunshine at the end because this is something we are doing for our kids and their kids. 
        If a bright future doesn't exist for them; we are going to create it. 
        Hence, our young team only works on projects that make a meaningful contribution to society and preserve the quality of life on our planet. 
        The first question that was in our mind was “How to help people think for themselves and believe in their capabilities?”
        This is when we realised the first step in transforming the world begins by EDUCATING and EMPOWERING the people around you and that’s why Ozigen was born. 
    </p>
    <p class="cont"> Ozigen is such a product of the parent company Ozibook that is contributing towards the field of EdTech. Just like how you cannot live without Oxygen, you cannot live without information, hence Ozigen. The platform is designed in a way to become a one stop solution for all your educational problems once implemented to its full form by leveraging the power of technology through peer learning. In short it’s a social media platform for the good. We want to make your social media time as productive as possible so you can have a distraction free learning experience from the creators you love to learn from. 
    </p>
    <p class="cont"> The passion for building products has always been in us as we are a team of elite problem solvers who want to use our collective knowledge for the good and leave the world in a better place than we found it.
